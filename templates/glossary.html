            <p>Below is a glossary of important terms used in the prediction model for preeclampsia in twins:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>cffDNA:</b> Cell-free fetal DNA test, which helps assess the risk of preeclampsia and other pregnancy-related complications.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>MAP (Mean Arterial Pressure):</b> The average blood pressure in an individual during a single cardiac cycle, which is a key indicator of preeclampsia risk.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>PLGF (Placental Growth Factor):</b> A protein involved in angiogenesis and placental development; low levels of PLGF are associated with preeclampsia.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>SFLT1 (Soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1):</b> A protein that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and placental growth factor (PLGF); elevated levels are indicative of preeclampsia.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>SFLT1/PLGF Ratio:</b> A ratio of the soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 to placental growth factor, which is used as a marker for preeclampsia risk.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Blood Type:</b> The patient's blood group, which can affect pregnancy outcomes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Nulliparous:</b> A term used to describe a woman who has never given birth to a viable offspring.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Diabetes Mellitus (DM):</b> A chronic condition affecting blood sugar regulation; women with diabetes are at a higher risk for preeclampsia.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Gestational Age (GA):</b> The duration of pregnancy, usually measured in weeks from the first day of the last menstrual period.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Pregnancy Trimester:</b> Refers to the three stages of pregnancy: the first trimester (0-12 weeks), second trimester (13-26 weeks), and third trimester (27 weeks to delivery).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Twins Pregnancy:</b> A pregnancy involving two fetuses, which can increase the likelihood of complications such as preeclampsia.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Blood Pressure at Admission:</b> The maternal blood pressure measured upon admission to the healthcare facility, which is a crucial indicator for preeclampsia risk.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>History of Previous Hospitalizations:</b> The number of hospital admissions the patient has had during the current pregnancy, which can indicate heightened risk.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Fetal Weight:</b> The estimated weight of the fetus, which may influence the prediction of preeclampsia in twin pregnancies.
                </li>
            </ul>
